Solve the single product inventory problem. Here the idea is to identify the optimal order for the product given a current inventory on-hand and uncertain sales.

There are 3 relevant scratchpads to look at
* `InvDP_scratchpad` demonstrates the use of the DP function in the toolbox to solve a few variations on the inventory problem. **START HERE**
* (old) `hw4_scratchpad` is the initial, standalone implementation (does not use the DP toolbox modular functions) for the same inventory problem in DP. Included for historic reasons.
* inventory_adp_scratchpad is the initial, standalone implementation (does not use the DP toolbox modular functions) of ADP for the same problem, and much larger variants. It uses Powell's CAVE value function approximation, which only works in 1-D

_TODO:_ Develop an InvADP example that uses as many of the InvDP functions as possible in combination with the ADP* functions in the toolbox.
