A multi-product extension to the inventory problem example. Here the objective is to identify the optimal order for multiple products as a function of the current inventory for each. A key challenge is that there is a space limit in the warehouse, and that different products may take up different quantities of space. 

Start with the MultiInv_demo.m function. 

_Note:_ Because DP exhastively lists all of the states, a key piece of efficient solution techniques is to figure out which aspects of the state space can be safely removed. For example any state that exceeds the capacity of the warehouse can be eliminated. Likewise the set of possible valid decisions for a given starting inventory is limited by remaining warehouse capacity. This state and decision space limiting is handled by using `setCombinWithLimits`. Incedentally, a similar phenomena occurs in the generation expansion planning problem where we know you will never need all of the possible generators of all types, rather there is some planning reserve based upper bound on the the total capacity.
